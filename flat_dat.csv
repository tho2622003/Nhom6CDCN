@Vailskibum,Thank God this movie was saved from being a tax write-off
@arthurluna6189,I like that mix of medieval with city aesthetic.
@Browniejet,"I cried throughout the whole movie. It was touching, well-crafted, and dig deep into people‚Äôs heart. Just love it a million times!"
@jessteban14,"TBH, this movie deserves its Annie's & Oscar's nomination, and I'm glad that this movie getting the love & recognition that it truly deserves. "
@raph9831,I think it's really interesting how they meshed the classic medieval aesthetic from the comic with a new futuristic one. It's strangely fitting
@jux2445,"This was originally going to be made by Blue Sky, but then the studio shut down and canceled the movie along with it. I'm so glad Netflix brought back this film from the dead. The animation looks so amazing, shows how much spider verse impacted the animation industry. I love the mix of medieval times and futuristic cyberpunk in this setting. I didn't finish the book as a kid, but hopefully the film can show me more than I asked for. Thank you Blue Sky.Ô∏è"
@catiscray4133,"This movie had no business making me feel this much. I started it because it looked funny. It was but jfc, it was so so much more. This movie is so beautiful I can't take it. I can't stop thinking about it."
@random_person6355,"I watched this movie and I'm here to say IT WAS AMAZING! I didn't think it would be good because it's a kids movie, but I watched it because I couldn't think of anything else and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The animation is phenomenal, I LOVE the world (it's like medieval √ó futuristic and im here for it). It also talks about mental health and has a great message that I believe kids and adults alike need to hear. If you were thinking of watching this but unsure, WATCH IT!!!"
@PikaPetey,Wish this was theatrical release... id totally go pay to see it in theaters.
@King_Andrew,"Her personality, her voice, her FANGS, her eyes glowing up whenever she's about to shift, Nimona's design is just perfect! Kudos to the  cartoonists and animators! "
@doortheexplorer_,I just got here from Oscar nomination list. I‚Äôm speechless and thrilled
@youshallgotobrazil7985,Haven't felt such a broad range of feelings so well in a film ever. MARVELOUS!
@brendonsmith3080,I just know this is going to be a major hit and Chloe Moretz is just nailing the voice acting well.
@tonymata8070,"I am absolutely LOVING the animation of Nimona's shape-shifting, it's incredibly smooth to look at."
@brianp235,"Absolutely amazing movie in every way. Actual characters that aren't the cookie cutter designs forced through Hollywood, super beautiful art, funny, really fun. It has everything."
@efug-gx9kh,"I really loved this movie a lot. I hope one day there will be a sequel that explains more about Nimona's background before she met and befriended Gloreth and then Ballistar, as well as dealing with new villains that comes with a shocking, revelation added to her past."
@sabisgambi3818,"Nimona was a fundamental part of my teen years. I remember reading this comic and it changed my point of view on narratives, on characters, on society, on everything. This looks different from what I expected, but I know it‚Äôs going to be awesome. Also shoutout to ND, he was really cool to meet at ECCC this past spring :3"
@sammyknapp1373,"I'll be interested to see how they play some of the darker elements of this story. Ballister and the Institute being toned down aside Nimona herself had such an unapologetic, ruthless, almost sinister, side to her in the comic that I could see being toned down for a kids movie. I hope they kept it though because that unnerving shift throughout the story of just being like ""Wait. What's really the deal with Nimona?"" more and more was so interesting and engaging to me"
@IDigAPony,"Nimona is  my favorite animated movie ever. One of the most uncomfortable experiences I've ever had.  If you've ever wondered how a company finds out that they're going to be ""dismantled,""  it can inadvertent and painful and ugly.   I was how Blue Sky found out.  I didn't realize it until I was talking to them there and it started to become obvious.  I won't go into the details, but I will say every person there was incredibly nice. "
@FrancieBurns,My sister showed me this movie today. I absolutely loved it! Thank you so much Netflix and Bluesky! 
@hepzi.,I'm so glad they kept the villian/hero ship and the fact that Nimona's almost like a daughter to him- plus the cyber-medievil look works so well?? I never thought of that!!
@Isaacarthy,"Everyone: ‚ÄúWere you killed?‚Äù, Nimona: ‚ÄúSadly, yes‚Ä¶ But I lived!‚Äù"
@rosesaredeadvioletsareblue,"I just watched it and I'm crying like a baby, it felt short. I needed more of it. Loved it Ô∏è and if there will be 2nd part I'll be definitely watching it. "
@Zxtx5Kim-sw5ep,Finished watching this 2 minutes ago‚Ä¶ what an amazing movie. Perfectly written. Hope there‚Äôs a sequel!
@jeremy1860,"I'm glad Stevenson was able to finally make this. He did great with an established property like She-Ra, so now let's see how he handles his own comic adaptation "
@snbsixteen6stars201,"This gives me early 2000's dreamworks feels but in 3D, gives these guys and girls of the animation department mad props for pulling off sutch stunning visuels"
@yiwoon_cr8s,I actually love how this movie does pathos in a way that makes sense to the context and message of the story
@user-pt3jp8ry5c,Just finished the film 5 minuses ago. Instantly fall in LOVE with those characters. And OMG Nimona is my spirit animal 
@yuber-aaron,"I love nimona's personality and design, the way she is impulsive and seems to have fun with what she does throughout the movie and the backstory she has and the ending of the movie which is like to continue with another one with the beautiful and striking art style it was for me."
@animechan000,I literally just watched the movie and I am so GLAD they were able to complete it and present this to us! It was 100% worth my time- the characters were refreshing and funny- LOVED the world building- and overall loved the quality of the movie!
@Purpylon,This is one of the best movies i've ever watched.
@jessteban14,Me revisiting this trailer once again coz I've already seen this movie and I love it so much.. I'm just glad that Netflix saved this movie and had turned into a masterpiece that it truly deserves. 
@bradleyogilvie8869,I really love how the world is a mix of medieval themes and sci-fi tech
@kappathefish7171,"I actually cried when I saw it was canceled, this story means so much to me I'm so glad Netflix saved it"
@nimona7391,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING! I was reluctant to watch it despite hearing amazing things about it bc I just generally don't have the patience for movies but THIS ONE WAS SO WORTH IT. I couldn't have stopped watching it if I wanted to. It had me crying and laughing and just generally in awe of the characters and the ART and the storyline and it's such a heartwarming and amazing movie that has such a genuine message. I know that I won't be able to stop thinking about this movie for a long long time bc it really had an impact on me. For those who haven't watched it yet, you really should!!!"
@catntmeows,One of the best movie I've watched this year. Ballister's love story really enhaced the film.
@levinemgl1,This movie is going to be absolutely amazing. 
@xapplejax141x,"I love how chaotic she is and the faces she makes are perfect, I can‚Äôt wait for this film"
@Anguisette,"Netflix, please never stop making great movies like Nimona."
@marvincorre4783,"This movie is great. The animation, voice acting, writing, humor, characters and story was amazing. Immediately a top 3 favorite movie of mine."
@GoatAmv,"This movie is great. The animation, voice acting, writing, humor, characters and story was amazing. Immediately a top 3 favorite movie of mine."
@andrewentwistle867,"Hearing Eugene Lee Yangs voice in this has me absolutely ECSTATIC. This looks like an amazing movie, can't wait to see it!"
@refahel,"Saw it yesterday. The trailer doesn't lie, it's a truly fun movie with an unusual approach."
@misspuffsxo,Honestly? Loved this so much and have already replayed the movie about 5+ times with my kiddos Hopefully they make more of this universe as we‚Äôre absolutely in love !!
@onepresence9460,"The fact that Disney cancelled this movie, Blue Sky Studios and we almost didn‚Äôt get it blows me away. I‚Äôm super glad this project got resurrected and it looks super duper awesome   "
@_marimopeace,1:07 so shooketh omg i was hella excited for Eugene's voice acting debut but i didn't expect him to sound this different ü•π good for him!! been a fan of ND Stevenson for years and i'm so thrilled that Nimona is finally making it to the small screen--can't wait for the end of this month!
@mollycblaeser,"I went into this movie not knowing anything & ended up loving this movie! It wasn't what I expected from the teaser but definitely still a wild, fun ride!"
@rodneypedroza4325,"everything about this movie was 10 / 10 !!! My wife and I were planning to give this movie 5 minutes, and then 90 minutes later we enjoyed every bit of it!"
@DenDarEmi,"Just finished it and was bawling at the end. There's few things that feels so bad than to feel like you don't belong, no mather where you go and how much you adapt yourself. People see something different and they ignore you or go against you"
@scandalf4209,The shapeshifting has a strong Madam Mim vs Merlin vibe from The Sword in the Stone. I like it!
@alexernst9448,Damn this is only 7 months ago? It already feels like a classic
@Cheesegoddess,‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a kid‚Ä¶IM A SHARK!!‚Äù
@shan3622,I love Nimona‚Äôs Chaotic personality she‚Äôs so amazing
@lorenzol9391,"Nimona is so charming, adorable and enthusiastic!! I loved it soooo much!"
@phangkuanhoong7967,This movie is a miracle and the best thing this year.
@Shmurph,I'm absolutely in love with the setting! The mashup of medieval fantasy and futuristic metropolis aesthetics is such a fun idea. This looks like a blast honestly.
@DanceofLies,"Usually I don't write comments on Youtube, but I had to come here and say something about this filmÖ Netflix, I freaking LOVED IT!! I went in with my doubts, but immediately fell in love with the characters, animation, and story. It's so wonderful to see animation that isn't rehashing their previously made animated movies, like other companies (cough cough Disney). A majority of the self reflection and character thoughts, reminded me of things that I went though or felt...I couldn't look away! "
@punkchaos1,In my opinion this is the best fairytale (or what do you call it?) that came out since my childhood. Big thumbs up!
@jamienez,"Eugene Lee Yang, you have arrived. You dropped this on your way in  "
@KevinKess,"If I'm honest, I will give this film credit for showing that it's still possible for a film/TV concept to be brought back and seen to completion in this day and age, even if it's done through someone else (though how Netflix was able to pull this off is beyond me). So on that point, I'll say: Here's hoping that this works out well for Netflix and everyone who's worked on the film as well as the graphic novel it's based on."
